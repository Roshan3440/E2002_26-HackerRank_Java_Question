My son Priyanshu got an assignment from his teacher to perform multiplication of complex number. Help him to complete his assignment. Write a java code with following features: class Name: Complex Instance Variable: real, imaginary (int type) Constructor: ** 1. Complex() 2. Complex(int, int)

**Instance Method: 1. Mul_Complex(Complex, Complex) 2. Display() Read the real and imaginary from user and pass to the constructor as parameter Write a separate class Test_Complex with a main() method and test the Complex class methods

Input Format

First line Read the complex number 1 for real and imaginary First line Read the complex number 2 for real and imaginary

Constraints

real, imaginary > 1

Output Format

Print the Result in form of complex number : a+bi

Sample Input 0

2 3
4 5
Sample Output 0

-7+22i
Sample Input 1

0 1
2 3
Sample Output 1

-3+2i
